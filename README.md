This project is an NLP-based Resume Classifier and ATS Scoring System developed using Streamlit. The application is designed to simulate the working of modern Applicant Tracking Systems by automatically classifying resumes into relevant job roles and assigning an ATS-style score based on how well a resume matches a given job description. The project focuses on practical machine learning techniques commonly used in real-world hiring systems.

The core of the system is a Support Vector Classifier (SVC), chosen for its strong performance on high-dimensional and sparse text data. Resume text is first cleaned and preprocessed to remove noise such as URLs, special characters, and irrelevant tokens. The processed text is then converted into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization, which captures the importance of keywords across documents. These features are passed to the SVC model to accurately predict the most suitable job role for each resume.

In addition to classification, the system computes an ATS score that represents the similarity between a candidate’s resume and a target job description. This score is calculated using cosine similarity on TF-IDF vectors, providing a quantitative measure of how closely a resume aligns with job requirements. The ATS score helps users understand their resume’s compatibility with automated screening systems and highlights areas where improvements may be needed.

The application supports resume uploads in both PDF and DOCX formats, making it practical for real-world use. Streamlit is used to build an interactive and user-friendly web interface where users can upload resumes, view predicted job roles, and receive ATS scores in real time. The end-to-end pipeline, from file upload to model inference and scoring, is fully integrated into a single web application.

This project serves as a strong demonstration of applied machine learning and natural language processing skills. It showcases the use of classical ML models like SVC, effective feature engineering with TF-IDF, similarity-based scoring methods, and deployment of ML models using Streamlit. The system is suitable for students preparing for placements, job seekers optimizing their resumes, and as a learning reference for building production-style ML applications.
